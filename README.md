# Welcome to Kristy's GitHub 😊

Hello there! (And I guess I must say Hello World as well!) 👋  

I am an aspiring software developer born and raised in Hong Kong ![HK flag](/HK@2x.png) but moved to the UK ![UK flag](/GB@2x.png) with my family in 2021.

Always keen on learning new skills, I'm switching to developing software solutions and ready to embark on a new career path.

Back in the high school days, I was addicted to updating the layout of my Xanga blog every now and then. Little did I know I was already programming. When studying for my master's degree in Library and Information Management between 2018 and 2020 while working full-time, I had the chance to code using bootstrap in an e-learning course where I created an engaging online course on Moodle. (By the way, I graduated with distinction 🌟🎉)

Aftering moving to the UK, I got admin jobs ✏️📘 again as I worked as an Executive Officer in the Hong Kong government for 10 years before. I did learn a lot about the work cultures in the UK and gained even more administrative and customer service experience, but as the work was mostly similar and I yearned for new challenges. I have been working as a Driving Instructor 🚗 since May 2023, which is one of the skills I've gained. However, this doesn't suit me well in terms of my health unfortunately so I am switching to something new again. I am now studying in two bootcamps to build up my tech stack.

I will be uploading more of my projects here so stay tuned! 🔭
